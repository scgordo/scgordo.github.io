  <section id="bio">
    <p>Elvis Aaron Presley was an American singer, dancer and actor. He was often referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll" or simply "the King".</p>
    
    <p>His music career began there in 1954. Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popularâ€”and controversial.</p>
    
    <p>Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, blues and gospel, he is one of the best-selling artists in the history of recorded music, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.</p>
